# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Due to the increasing number of customers as well 
as the increasing number of companies that use credit cards for 
ending financial transactions, the number of fraud cases has 
increased dramatically. Dealing with noisy and imbalanced data,
as well as with outliers, has accentuated this problem. In this 
work, fraud detection using artificial intelligence is proposed. 
The proposed system uses logistic regression to build the 
classifier to prevent frauds in credit card transactions.
